## What have we learned?

### Copy
Here are some of the types that implement `Copy`:
- All the integer types, such as `u32`.
- The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
- All the floating point types, such as `f64`.
- The character type, `char`.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example, `(i32, i32)` implements Copy, but `(i32, String)` does not.

### Mutable References

The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion. It’s something that new Rustaceans struggle with, because most languages let you mutate whenever you’d like. The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent `data races` at compile time. A `data race` is similar to a `race condition` and happens when these three behaviors occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

1. Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix when you’re trying to track them down - - at runtime; Rust prevents this problem by refusing to compile code with data races!

2. We also cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one to the same value.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
}
```

Note that a reference’s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used. For instance, this code will compile because the last usage of the immutable references, the println!, occurs before the mutable reference is introduced:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
}
```

### The Rules of References

Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:

- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.
